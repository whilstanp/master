Controls
The controls are very simple. By default you got a button for accelerating and keeping the speed. You can press another button to take tight turns (drifting/skitting/cornering). Logically you retain your momentum and speed while smoothly taking those sharp turns. There is a button for firing your spellcards or cycling through them.
Z = Accelerate / speed
X = Cornering/drifting or reverse
C = Spell card shuffle / fire
V = Partner switch
Backspace = View rear camera.
