[Intro]

[Verse A]
I’m a hippie in your eyes
I’m not worthy of your attention
Am I a plaything to you?
You’re a pedo maniac
Hitting sexy girls like a horny predator
Although my feelings to you are genuine

[Pre-chorus]
Why there are fuckboys around me?
I only need your attention, nothing more

[Chorus]
I’ve had enough (2x)
I shouldn’t ever date a playboy
You’re even lower than scum (2x)
I won’t ever date cheap guys anymore

[Short break]

[Verse B]
I'm losing my appetite
When you stare at the maknae meticulously
Uhhh... Why you suddenly changed?
I'm aware that i'm getting older
But that excuse is so old-fashioned
You made me looked like a degenerate
 
[Pre-chorus]
Why there are fuckboys around me?
I only need your attention, nothing more

[Chorus]
I’ve had enough (2x)
I shouldn’t ever date a playboy
You’re even lower than scum (2x)
I won’t ever date cheap guys anymore

[Chorus]
I’ve had enough (2x) 
I shouldn’t ever date a playboy
You’re even lower than scum (2x)
I won’t ever date cheap guys anymore

[Long breaks]

[Bridge]
Kill yourself immediately
----------------------
I wanna puke
I wanna insult
----------------------
I should be known
You’re one of those lowlifes

[Breaks]

[Chorus]
I’ve had enough (2x) 
I shouldn’t ever date a playboy
You’re even lower than scum (2x)
I won’t ever date cheap guys anymore

[Chorus]
I’ve had enough (2x)
I shouldn’t ever date a playboy
You’re even lower than scum (2x)
I won’t ever date cheap guys anymore

[Outro]
